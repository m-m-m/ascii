== mmm-text-ascii

The module `io.github.mmm.text.ascii` (artifactId `mmm-ascii`) provides a efficient conversion from unicode to ASCII.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode[Unicode] is an awesome and powerful standard but is also extremely complex.
This can cause unexpected problems e.g. two `String` values may not be equal even though they are optically and semantically equivalent.
Just to give one example the character `Ã¤` can also be written as a https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+0308[combining diaresis] character followed by an `a`.
As a result your implementation to compare, search, or otherwise process texts can produce unexpected results.
Further, when you have a name from arbitrary user-input and you need to use that in a path of the file-system or to derive a business key you may not want to allow any unicode character to avoid problems.

=== Features

This library offers the following features:

* Transformation of any unicode text to a corresponding `String` only containing 7-bit ASCII characters.
* Highly optimized for performance: ultra fast and low memory footprint due to lazy loading of mappings per code-point high-bytes.
* Support for simplified transliteration.
It is not fully compatible to standards like ISO-843, ISO-9:1995, ISO-15919, ISO 11940-2:2007, etc.
So if you look for accuracy this is the wrong place.
However, if a "good enough" approach is enough you have found a great solution.
* Extremely robust due to is simplicity. Any input is accepted and you will get ASCII output.
